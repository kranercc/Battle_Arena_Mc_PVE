# PVE Battle Arena for Minecraft


Current version 0.1

### Logic


-> Teleport player to coordonates

-> Display game start

-> Begin the game


-> Spawn mobs (based on current player position, in kUtils are the math functions, that calculate locations around player and all that)

-> Keep track of waves

-> Increase mob dificulty based on current wave number


### Stuff

Used holographic design package to display the stats
